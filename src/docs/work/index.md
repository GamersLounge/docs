# Introduction

Welcome to Gamers Lounge. This basic guide will lead you through the main points of our work environment and guidelines. Please, take your time reading it.

Our organization has a holacracy structure. This means all employees have roles, but you can have multiple roles at the same time. For example, you can be assigned as a backend developer but at some point you were given a task that require a basic frontend knowledge.
This might seem chaotic at firs glance and counterproductive but once you get past the learning curve it won't be as stressful or complicated as it might seem now, actually it's one of the fastest way to quickly gain new skills and expand your knowledge.

We highly encourage you to be proactive. You can make up your own tasks if you didn't receive one, fix issues and bugs before you are asked to, think about what you can improve and start doing it, and always work on your personal and technical skills whenever you can.
Do not be afraid to show initiative discuss your ideas with your co-workers and start doing them.
